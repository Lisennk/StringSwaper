## Installation and usage
"StringSwaper" it's a simple library to swap substrings in string, written in TypeScript and available via [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/string-swaper) and as [compiled JS](https://github.com/Lisennk/StringSwaper/tree/master/dist). 

**Usage example:**
```
let context:string = `I like tea, but my friend likes coffee`;
let result:string = swaper.swap('tea', 'coffee', context);

// Now result is 'I like coffee, but my friend likes tea'
```

I wrote up it as experiment with TS, but if you found any error, please, report it to **Issues**.
